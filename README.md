 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using SQL, Machine Learning (Python), and Power BI. The goal is to identify churn patterns, improve customer retention, and optimize business strategies.

Business Objective
Identify high-risk customers who are likely to churn.

Understand key reasons for churn (customer service calls, pricing, plan types, etc.).

Suggest actionable strategies to reduce churn and increase retention.

🛠️ Tech Stack
SQL (Data Cleaning & Analysis)

Python (Machine Learning Models)

Power BI (Dashboard & Reporting)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed in SQL & Excel to find:
✅ Churn trends based on plan types & customer service calls
✅ Identified churn rate per state
✅ Average call duration & revenue loss

🤖 Machine Learning Model
Used Python (Scikit-Learn) to predict churn:
✅ Logistic Regression
✅ Decision Tree
✅ Random Forest (Best Model → 94.7% Accuracy)

📈 Power BI Dashboard
Created a fully interactive dashboard to visualize churn insights:
✅ Churn Rate by Customer Category (Stacked Bar Chart)
✅ Churn Distribution by Plan Type (Pie Chart)
✅ Churn Rate by State (Map)
✅ Total Charge by International Plan (Clustered Column Chart)

📢 Key Takeaways
High-risk customers have long call durations & frequent customer service calls.

Customers with international plans & high total charges have a higher churn rate.

Retention strategies should include discounts, improved customer support, and flexible plans.

This project provides valuable business insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention. By using SQL, Machine Learning, and Power BI, we can help telecom companies take data-driven actions to enhance customer satisfaction.
